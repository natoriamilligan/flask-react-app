# Banksie

## ❓ About
I originally created this banking app to practice Python. After I got a grasp on the language I wanted to learn how APIs work and practice creating one. Soon after that, I started learning more about cloud computing and AWS. I wanted to have a multi tier app to deploy on the cloud so I decided to add a frontend to pair with the API. 

I also decided that this project would be a great way for me to learn React and React Bootstrap so you will see lots of mistakes and changes as I learn.

This app will primarily be used to practice cloud labs so there are many features that need to be implemented (see Roadmap), however I will continue to update the app frequently.
