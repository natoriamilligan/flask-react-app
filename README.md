# Banksie

## ❓ About
I originally created this banking app to practice Python. After I got a grasp on the language I wanted to learn how APIs work and practice creating one. Soon after that, I started learning more about cloud computing and AWS. I wanted to have a multi tier app to deploy on the cloud so I decided to add a frontend to pair with the API I created.
